# Todo App Overview

## Purpose
A todo application that evolves from a console app to a full-stack web app and finally to an AI chatbot.

## Current Phase
Change this value as the project moves through phases (see `.spec-kit/config.yaml`).

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI, SQLModel, PostgreSQL
- Auth: Better Auth (JWT-based for internal endpoints)

## Features
- Task CRUD operations
- User authentication
- Task filtering and sorting
- Chatbot integration (phase3)

## Acceptance
The application is considered successful when tasks can be created/updated/completed/deleted and, in phase3, managed via natural language through the chatbot with proper use of MCP tools.
